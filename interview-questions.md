# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: method that is done over and over until we get every return

  Researched answer:  performing an action a number of times until a condition is met. Loop is an example.  It defines a variable and increments or decrements the variable. for loop will run until it is false.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: value, index, array. Value is required. 

  Researched answer:  looking at notes I got confused. But I think it is required because $this needs a value or it will be undefined



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: undo values from arrays

  Researched answer: breaking an object down into recallable variables



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Method is in a class. Function is

  Researched answer:  functions pass the data that is operated and may return the data. The method operates the data contained in a Class. Data passed to a function is explicit. A method implicitly passes the object on which it was called.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: an object is in a class. Class is in Pascal case

  Researched answer: a class declares an object but a class doesnt hold memory until it is pair with an object



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: elisa was trying to explain it to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant remember!

  Researched answer:  moving all declarations to the top of the script...using var not let or const
  declares into memory before it executes any code/allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code.
